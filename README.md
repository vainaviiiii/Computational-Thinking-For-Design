SUTD Term 1 -> [10.014] Computational Thinking For Design -> Introductory Course to Python, JSON -> Cohort and Homework Excercises

Each group had the opportunity to also design and work on a final 1D game project, by only using Python.

Thanks to the support and passion of my groupmates, my group (F01K) had won 2 inter-class awards in honour of "best code" and "best ASCII Art".
